# audio-recommendation-system
This repository contains an end-to-end audio-based music recommendation system built with Streamlit, PyTorch, and Librosa. The system extracts deep audio embeddings using a contrastive-learning CNN encoder, compares them against a large library of precomputed embeddings, and returns the most similar songs based on cosine similarity.
